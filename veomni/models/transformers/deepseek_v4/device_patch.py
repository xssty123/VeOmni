    """Backend selection for the patchgen-generated module.

    Only ``rotary_pos_emb`` is wired here. Replacing the module-level
    ``apply_rotary_pos_emb`` covers every call site at once — Q, MQA KV, the
    inverse rotation on the attention output, the indexer Q, and the three
    compressors all resolve it through the module global.

    Both registry defaults are explicitly disabled. V4 rotates only the trailing
    ``qk_rope_head_dim`` slice with an interleaved cos/sin layout, which neither
    ``liger_rotary_pos_emb`` nor ``npu_rotary_mul`` implements (partial_rotary ->
    NaN), and both expect a ``(q, k, cos, sin)`` pair returning two tensors
    rather than V4's single tensor. ``npu`` is doubly inapplicable: V4 has no NPU
    patchgen config. ``None`` yields a clean "explicitly disabled" error instead
    of a wrong-signature crash or silent garbage, so the surviving choices are
    ``triton`` and ``eager`` — V4 YAMLs pin ``rotary_pos_emb_implementation``
    because the registry default (``liger_kernel``) is among the disabled ones.
